# Default TODO destination and flake discipline

## Default TODO destination

When the human asks to file a todo without naming a destination, file a record in Linear (team `COI`), with the repository the work actually touches as its `repo` label. `inbox` is the fallback only when no repository is clearly relevant. The tracker moved off Teable at the epic 51 cutover, and Teable is frozen. The reason it is not Forgejo, confirmed 2026-09-02 and re-verified 2026-09-03: every repository in the fleet reports `has_issues: false` except `coilysiren/coilysiren`, so `POST /issues` returns 404 on Forgejo even under `admin`, `list_issue` returns an empty array, and `open_issues_count` still serves the pre-migration number. That count is a fossil rather than a queue.

Forgejo stays canonical for git history, branches, pull requests, and releases. Only the issue tracker moved. Cite a record as `COI-<n>`. A `teable:<owner>/<repo>#<n>` ref names a frozen pre-cutover record, and a bare `<owner>/<repo>#<n>` still means Forgejo, which is where pull requests and historical issues live. The `closes <forgejo url>` trailer is retired along with the trackers, so closing a record is a separate deliberate step that no commit performs for you. Mechanics, field mapping, and resolving an old `teable:` ref: `docs/linear-tracker.md` in `agentic-os-kai`.

GitHub issues on external-facing `coilysiren/*` repos remain an inbox for external contributors only, and agents never file there. The old `hasIssuesEnabled` split no longer classifies anything, since the flag is now false fleet-wide for reasons unrelated to whether a repo faces outward.

**Never ask whether to file an issue. Just file it.** If you're about to ask "should I file an issue for X" or offer it as a choice, the answer is always yes - file it and mention in one line what you filed. Issues are post-it notes: cheap, swept up by backlog routines. Asking is pure overhead, and at Kai's pace a deferred "want me to file this?" is something she will miss. Applies to any issue surfaced mid-task.

## Test flake discipline

Every flaky-test sighting in a fleet repo becomes a tracker record tagged to that repo, no exceptions (flaky = failed then passed on re-run with no code change, or non-deterministic across two runs). File immediately, even mid-task: test name, both runs' output, candidate causes. Don't paper over by re-running until green.
