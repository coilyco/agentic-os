# Structured decisions

The fleet makes structured decisions through Jev, a typed model for closed-set
answers. A structured decision is one whose answer comes from a closed set:
pick one option, rate against ordered levels, or give the probability that a
statement is true. This skill is the operational detail behind the one-line
rule in `AGENTS.md`.

## Verdicts in conversation

An answer to a human that ends in a verdict is a structured decision too. Should
I, go or no-go, which option, how to rank, how likely: the reasoning stays
generative, and the verdict goes to Jev. Write the state before forming a view,
so Jev grades the evidence rather than the seat's framing, and report the
probabilities beside the call.

A likelihood is the easiest verdict to miss, because "what are the chances of X"
reads as factual. Any percent or odds you would otherwise state is a Score over
probability bands, asked once per horizon in one request. Report the modal band,
its probability, and the confidence, never a number of your own beside it.

Before every AskUserQuestion, sort the questions. A question the evidence
settles goes to Jev first: a size, cap, threshold, ranking, or which option
fits. Only what Jev cannot hold goes to the human: a preference, an authority,
a fact only they have, or a Jev answer below confidence. A question tool with a
recommended option already written is the tell that the seat judged it
answerable, so that judgment belongs to Jev.

## Pick the primitive

- **Choice** - one option from a defined set, with a probability per option and
  a `confidence`. Reliable up to roughly 240 options.
- **Score** - a rating against ordered, described levels, at most ten. Use the
  expectation to test a threshold, never to reconstruct an exact number. Options
  with a natural order (sizes, caps, severities, tiers) are a Score even when
  they read as a pick. As a Choice, neighbouring values split the probability
  and confidence collapses. The request carries `criteria` as a list of level
  descriptions, lowest first, and the answer indexes them from 0.
- **Noul** - the probability that one yes/no statement is true. Word it to mean
  exactly what you want, because Jev reads literally.

Ask every question about one state in one request. Extra questions cost no
extra round trip.

## Where Jev stops

- **Deterministic checks stay code.** A regex, parser, lookup, sender list, or
  argv validator is not a model decision. Jev takes only what that layer leaves
  uncovered.
- **Generation stays generative.** Jev writes no text, code, or summaries.
- **Counting, arithmetic, and date comparison stay in code.** Jev extracts the
  parts, code does the math.
- **No images.** Jev takes text only.

## The call contract

1. Call Jev through Agent Proxy. A bulk pass calls the batch endpoint directly;
   an interactive pass calls one tool per primitive. The harness overlay names
   the call surface.
2. Keep the questions and thresholds in one file per call site, so a reviewer
   reads the decision surface in one place.
3. Branch on `confidence`, not the winner's probability. Below threshold, fall
   back to the broader answer, a deterministic default, or a human. A site with
   no low-confidence branch is not finished.
4. Pin the versioned model id once a threshold is tuned. `jev-latest` moves on
   release.
5. Treat state as untrusted. Jev does not treat content as hostile, so mail,
   web, and chat text can steer it. Put the boundary cases in the criteria and
   filter irrelevant state out first.
6. Send nothing that is a secret. Everything else may go. The provider does not
   train on requests.

## Where Jev runs

Jev is TypeSafe's hosted API (`api.typesafe.ai`), not a model the fleet
serves, so it needs no GPU and no homelab host. Agent Proxy's `/v1/systemone`
shim forwards to it with the one provider key, mounted as a file, and answers
503 when the shim is disabled. Wherever Agent Proxy runs, Jev comes with it once
that key is mounted and outbound HTTPS is open. Hosted chat routes are the
separate dependency: they go through LiteLLM and fail closed in direct mode, so
relocating the proxy for answers relocates LiteLLM too.

## Worked patterns

The upstream cookbooks are the reference implementations. The three mapped onto
fleet work:

- **Skill suggestion** - rank the whole roster, re-check the top three with full
  text, suggest at most one.
- **Classification using confidence** - the specific label when sure, its parent
  when not.
- **Autoresearch feature discovery** - a generative model proposes questions,
  Jev answers them for every labelled row, a small model learns the label from
  the answers, and the worst misses drive the next round.

## Bundled runner

`scripts/feature-retirement.py ROOT OUT` asks, for every `docs/FEATURES.md`
entry under `ROOT`, whether the feature is worth its upkeep: a noul on lost
value and a retire, shrink, keep, or core score. Set `JEV_PROXY_URL` to the
Agent Proxy base URL. The run resumes from `OUT/answers.jsonl` and writes
`OUT/ranked.json`. FEATURES pages describe themselves favorably and carry no
usage data, so re-ask a top candidate with the facts the page leaves out
before acting, as a scheduled event or a live consumer.
