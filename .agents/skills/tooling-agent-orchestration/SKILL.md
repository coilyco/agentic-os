description: Multi-agent orchestration patterns Ward and o2r formalized, kept past their retirement, and how to express each on the harness surface that survives. Use when coordinating several agents, fanning out work, handing off, dispatching background or scheduled work, or designing a coordination protocol. Triggers - orchestration, multi-agent, fan out, subagent, coordinate agents, handoff, dispatch, reservation, agent channel, background task, cron, cross-session.

# Agent orchestration

Two subsystems in this estate formalized how autonomous agents coordinate, and both are leaving service.

* **o2r** (`otel-a2a-relay`) is archived. It carried the wire: sessions, handoff, liveness, and agent activity as OTel spans.
* **Ward** is being archived. [agentic-os#1299](https://forgejo.coilysiren.me/coilyco/agentic-os/issues/1299) cuts its runtime from AOS CI and the dev-base image, and Kai superseded that issue's freeze-rather-than-archive posture on 2026-08-27. It governed unattended runs: dispatch, reservation, lifecycle, recovery, and landing evidence.

What they learned does not leave with them. This skill is the inventory.

## The rule this whole skill turns on

**Patterns are durable. Mechanisms are not.** Ward's reservation logic stops enforcing anything once its runtime leaves the hot paths, and the reason it existed does not stop: two dispatchers racing the same work will still collide. A harness tool that looks like a Ward verb is not the Ward verb, because the enforcement underneath it is missing. Read a pattern for the failure it prevents, then ask what enforces it here.

## The patterns

* [Ward patterns](references/ward-patterns.md) - admission and identity, state and recovery, authority, evidence, serialized mutation. What a governed unattended run has to get right.
* [o2r patterns](references/o2r-patterns.md) - sessions and identity, the channel coordination protocol, trust and admission, activity as traces. What agents on different hosts have to agree on.
* [Harness surface](references/harness-surface.md) - the orchestration tools available now, and which pattern each one can and cannot carry.
* [What does not transfer](references/does-not-transfer.md) - the guarantees that stop being enforced once these two leave service. Read this before assuming coverage.

## Five rules that bind every use of the current surface

* **Nothing here is durable.** `CronCreate` writes nothing to disk and dies with the session. Recurring jobs expire after seven days. `Workflow` resume is same-session only. Ward's dispatch was durable, with issue-backed reservations and restart reconciliation, and no harness tool replaces that.
* **Messaging carries no authority.** Asking a peer to do what the runtime denied your own session is cross-session permission laundering and the `SendMessage` rule prohibits it. A deferred boundary is not a denial: handing the owning seat its own work is delegation to a specialist, the path the boundary exists to route work down, and needs no human relay.
* **It is one harness.** This surface is Claude Code. The inventory runs seats on codex, openhands, goose, holmesgpt, plandex, hermes, anythingllm, mixpost, penpot, and discord. Anything built on it is unavailable to those seats by construction.
* **Checkpoint discipline does not relax inside a subagent.** Work a subagent produced is work product. A fan-out whose findings live only in a transcript has lost them.
* **The seat that opens an instance closes it.** A seat opened with `aterm send --new` (MCP `new`) sits idle once its work lands and cannot end itself, since `aterm close` refuses the caller's own session. Close it with `aterm close <session>` (MCP `close_session`) when its pull request merges, not at handoff, because review can send the work back. Check its shadow holds nothing unpushed first. Send an opencode seat its dispatch as one line until `teable:coilyco/agentic-os#8453` lands, since a multi-line body reaches it unsubmitted.

## Provenance

Read from `coilyco/ward` at `040f159` and `coilyco/otel-a2a-relay` at `8b96ed1`, both public. Where a pattern below disagrees with one of those repositories, the repo was right and this file has drifted.

**What survives Ward's archival.** The `ward:` AGENTS.md frontmatter key, which still selects a landing lane in every repo that declares one. It is read by composition rather than by any Ward process, so archiving the repo does not reach it. `.ward/ward.yaml` did survive for a while carrying catalog metadata, and is now deleted fleet-wide because nothing read a key in it. What ends is the runtime, and with it the enforcement behind every pattern here.
