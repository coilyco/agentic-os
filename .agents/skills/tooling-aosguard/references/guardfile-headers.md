# Guardfile headers

Why each `aosguard` guardfile is shaped the way it is. This lived in each
file's own header until the two-line comment cap reached YAML and KDL, and a
skill's `references/` takes no size cap, so it lands here whole.

## `actions.kdl`

AOSguard's Forgejo Actions log bridge. One verb, because it is the only Actions operation that still needs code: it unpacks a run ZIP, resumes by byte range in chunks, and caps the read, none of which a REST passthrough does. Listing left this file in agentic-os#1502's follow-up - `ops forgejo action-run list` and friends resolve the same endpoints from the spec on Forgejo 16, so the packaged list and rerun modules were redundant and are gone. Rerun went with them, and it 404'd on this Forgejo (agentic-os#1428).


## `aws.kdl`

aosguard ops aws - the AWS CLI surface as an allowlist (umbra execverb). Each grant reads like the invocation you'd type: `can run <service> <operation>`. A per-operation guard constrains the kwarg or positional that names the resource - the `--secret-id` value, the s3:// positional - with no env-var escape and no opaque gate. An operation not listed here is denied.

## `forgejo-admin.kdl`

Forgejo operations Forgejo refuses to the coilyco-ops bot, which is an org member holding push rather than an owner holding repo-admin. The separate wrapper keeps ordinary reads and writes on the bot token. Rationale: the tooling-aosguard skill.

## `forgejo-storage.kdl`

Application-aware Forgejo storage measurement. The generic kubectl surface keeps exec denied. This sealed bridge fixes every target and command in the packaged module, so callers cannot turn measurement into a remote shell.

## `update.kdl`

`aosguard update brew` - a top-level sibling of `ops`, because it updates the estate's own
tooling rather than operating a backend. One sealed verb running three phases in order:
`brew update`, then every installed `coilyco-flight-deck/tap` formula, then a general
`brew upgrade`.

The order is the whole point. A bare `brew upgrade` resolves against tap metadata already
on disk, so it can report success having installed nothing, which is how `aos` sat at
0.296.0 while the tap carried 0.297.0 and `agent-compose` sat fourteen minor versions
behind (agentic-os#6831). Our formulae go first so a failure later in the general upgrade
cannot leave the tooling this estate runs on behind.

The formula list is read from `brew list` at runtime rather than tracked here. A tracked
inventory would be a second copy of something the tap already owns, and going stale is the
exact defect the command exists to catch.

## `forgejo.kdl`

Forgejo ops surface for the standalone AOSguard bundle. AOS authors it and AOSguard ships it. Ward mounts the built binary and owns nothing in here, and no leaf below defers a decision to Ward existing. Every `can` resolves its operationId by convention (verb + resource -> method + path). Hardened per ward#109: orgs and repos lose their irreversible verbs, repo-label CRUD moves to org-labels, and every path-{owner} leaf is scoped to coily* owners. Repo-level label create/edit are additionally policy-disabled per ward#107 (dup priority-tier prevention). The issue surface is gone: issue, issue-comment, issue-label, issue-pin, milestone and the create/view/comment/move-issue actions were removed once every repository but `coilysiren/coilysiren` reported `has_issues` false and the tracker moved to Teable, because a mounted verb against a disabled unit reads as a working path. Auto-resolution per umbra#147. See the tooling-aosguard skill.

## `helm.kdl`

aosguard ops helm - Helm releases as an allowlist (umbra execverb, exec dialect). Wraps the image-baked `helm`, the other half of the cluster-write surface `kubectl.kdl` covers. Added for agentic-os#1502, which measured 40 helm mutation call sites across `coilyco/infrastructure` and `coilyco/deploy` and found 37 of them naming no cluster at all.

`--kube-context` is required on every call and allowlisted to the two k3s clusters this estate runs, at wrap level so a later grant cannot forget it. Helm spells the selector `--kube-context` where kubectl spells it `--context`, which is the one place the two guardfiles cannot be read as copies of each other. The estate was not uniformly unpinned before this, it was inconsistently pinned - `deploy/scripts/deprovision-aws-ssm-mcp.sh` names the context on one line and omits it on the line above, against the same release - and a wrap-level `only pass` is what makes that particular inconsistency unrepresentable.

Every leaf additionally carries `deny-when kubeconfig matches "*"`, which `kubectl.kdl` does not yet. Allowlisting a context **name** pins a string rather than a target, because a kubeconfig context name is a local label that any file may define and point anywhere. The name guard and the file guard are only together a pinned cluster. Per-leaf rather than wrap-level because umbra refuses a wrap-level `deny-when` outside an `allow` list, by design and fail-closed. The matching gap on the kubectl surface is agentic-os#1506, deliberately left out of the helm change so a new surface is not held back by the risk of changing an old one.

Reads mount release state (`list`, `status`, `history`, `get`) and the two offline renderers (`template`, `lint`, `show`). Writes mount the friendly deploy surface (`upgrade`, `install`, `rollback`). `upgrade --install` is how every rollout in deploy actually invokes it. `uninstall` mounts, marked irreversible, so attended deprovision in coilyco/deploy is audited and cluster-pinned rather than reaching bare helm around the guard. It removes a release and everything it owns, and takes the history with it, so there is no rollback afterwards - the same class as `forgejo-admin package delete`. Its `delete` alias stays denied so the destructive spelling is the explicit one. `repo`, `registry`, `push`, `plugin`, `package`, and `create` stay denied because each changes where a chart comes from or runs code from one, which is a supply-chain decision rather than an operator verb. See the tooling-aosguard skill.

## `kubectl.kdl`

aosguard ops kubectl - host-native kubectl as an allowlist (umbra execverb, exec dialect). Wraps the image-baked `kubectl` (k3s over the tailnet). `exec` fixes the binary, never the cluster: this comment used to claim the target could not be substituted while `--context` reached kubectl unconstrained, so the wrap-level `only pass` below names the cluster on every call and allowlists it (#1348). Deny-by-default: only the read verbs (including `diff`, the non-mutating server-side preview of an apply) and the friendly deploy surface (apply / scale / rollout) mount. Destructive and shell-equivalent verbs (delete, drain/cordon, edit, patch, replace, exec, attach, cp, port-forward) are intentionally left unexposed - they fall to the host lockdown's bare-kubectl deny. Every grant audit-logs through the generated binary's own umbra audit path, which needs no other tool present. See the tooling-aosguard skill.

The context allowlist also carries `gke_coilyco_us-west1-a_coilyco`, the GKE cluster from `coilyco/infrastructure` `terraform/gcp-gke/`, under the exact name `gcloud container clusters get-credentials` writes, so no rename step sits between credentials and use. Helm does not carry it: the GKE rollouts in `coilyco/deploy` render charts offline with `helm template` and apply through this surface.

`annotate` is the one incident write, Kai's grant under `teable:coilyco/agent-compose#8288`: `externalsecret` only, one `force-sync` or `force-sync/<suffix>` key, no fourth positional, and only `--namespace` and `--context` as flags. `argv` pins `--overwrite` rather than allowlisting it, because umbra refuses a boolean long flag beside `argN` guards and has no way to declare one. Short `-n` is not accepted, since the positional reader honors `value-flag` for long flags only and would read its value as a key.

## `netlify.kdl`

aosguard ops netlify - the Netlify site surface as an allowlist (umbra execverb). The token resolves from SSM at exec time rather than living in a caller's environment, matching `aosguard ops actions`. Every leaf runs the packaged module, so a caller cannot reach the rest of the Netlify API.

`--site` is required on every leaf and allowlisted to the one site this estate owns. agentic-os#1349 closed a wrap that documented a fixed target while accepting any, and a new surface is where that class comes back.

Only the alias leaf writes, and it is read-modify-write: the API replaces `domain_aliases` wholesale, so sending one alias would delete the rest. It adds and removes in one call, because a rename split across two writes is two certificate events on a live site. See the tooling-aosguard skill.

## `redis.kdl`

aosguard ops redis - the Redis read surface as an allowlist (umbra execverb, exec dialect). Wraps redis-cli from redis-tools in the dev-base image.

The store this exists for is the shared mcp-beaver rate-limit bucket in coilyco/deploy services/mcp-ratelimit. Its whole content is a few small keys with TTLs, which is why `keys` is exposed at all: on a store this size the O(N) objection does not apply, and `scan` is here for the habit.

AUTH COMES FROM THE ENVIRONMENT, NEVER FROM ARGV. redis-cli reads REDISCLI_AUTH, and the two flags that would take a password on the command line - `-a` and `-u` - are absent from every allowlist below, so the guard rejects them. That is enforcement rather than convention: a flag not named in an `allow-flag` list is refused before the process runs.

WRITES ARE NOT HERE, AND THE REASON IS MONEY. A bucket key holds a spend budget, so `set` fabricates budget and `flushall` resets every budget at once. Neither is an agent verb. `del` is the one exception and is exposed deliberately: unsticking a single wedged bucket is ordinary operations, and it is bounded to one key at a time. `config set` stays denied because maxmemory-policy is load-bearing - moving it off noeviction turns an eviction into a silent budget reset, which is the failure the store exists to prevent.


## `tailscale.kdl`

aosguard ops tailscale - the tailnet live-observe surface as an allowlist (umbra execverb, exec dialect). Wraps the image-baked `/usr/local/bin/tailscale` client so a live-observe surface can answer "is the tailnet up, is the peer reachable" itself instead of handing a human a runbook (agentic-os#447, the infrastructure#538 gap). Read-only by design: status/ping/netcheck and friends mount, while the state-changing verbs (up/down/login/logout/set/serve/funnel/ssh/file) stay denied - joining or reshaping the tailnet is ward's container bring-up axis, never an agent verb. AOSguard stays independent from Ward's fixed broker surface.

**The tailnet-wide device and tag inventory is here, not on an API leaf.** `status --json` carries `Tags`, `HostName`, `TailscaleIPs`, and `Online` for every peer, which answers "what tags does the tailnet actually report for this host" from the netmap the policy was evaluated against. agentic-os#1503 proposed promoting `list_tailscale_devices.py` from coilyco/infrastructure onto an API leaf. Measuring first showed the local verb already answers it, so no leaf, no credential, and no new SSM parameter were added.

**There is deliberately no `acl` leaf, and there cannot be an agent-readable one.** Reading or rewriting the tailnet policy needs admin scope, and that credential is operator-held only by design: the ACL decides which machines an agent can SSH into, so its credential stays unreadable by the agents it governs (`coilyco/infrastructure` `docs/tailscale.md`). The `/tailscale/admin/oauth-client-{id,secret}` path some older docstrings still name is retired, and live SSM holds nothing under `/tailscale/` at all. A guarded ACL verb would have to put that credential in an agent-readable store, which inverts the boundary rather than guarding it.
