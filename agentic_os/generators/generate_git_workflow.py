"""Generate and check the managed git-workflow block in a repo's AGENTS.md.

A lane declared once as `ward.workflow` was then hand-stamped in one line that
said what the lane was without saying it is a standing authorization, so an agent
still treated a commit or a push as worth stopping to ask about, and the turn
ended with work stranded in a dirty worktree (agentic-os#1150). The block states
the pre-authorization in MUST and NEVER terms, with `--no-verify` and force-push
closed in the same breath. See docs/features-agents.md.

* `{PR_AND_MERGE}` - the agent commits to a task branch, pushes it, opens a pull request, and merges that pull request itself once it is green.

**Every lane slug names what the AGENT does, never what someone else does.** `{PR_AND_MERGE}` carries the merge because the agent that authored the code merges its own pull request. `{PULL_REQUEST}` drops `-and-merge` because the author stops at the pull request and the director merge lane takes over. Reading `{PR_AND_MERGE}` as "someone else merges it later" inverts the two and leaves finished work sitting unmerged.

**These actions are pre-authorized on every lane, and the agent MUST take them without asking first.** Committing, creating a branch, pushing a branch, pushing the lane's own destination, and opening a pull request are ordinary reversible work, not the destructive wall that earns a question. Stopping to ask is how a turn ends with the work stranded in a dirty worktree.

* **ALWAYS commit** in-scope work and **ALWAYS push** it to the canonical remote before pausing, reporting a checkpoint, handing off, or ending a turn. A local-only commit is not a checkpoint.
* **ALWAYS open the pull request** in the same turn as the branch's first push, on every lane except `{BRANCH_ONLY}`. A pushed branch with no pull request is litter nobody reviews.
* **NEVER `--no-verify`** and **NEVER force-push**. Those two are the real walls, and they stay closed.
* **ALWAYS merge your own pull request on `{PR_AND_MERGE}`**, in the same turn, as soon as it is green. Reporting it as open and awaiting someone is the failure this lane exists to prevent.
* **A merge refused with 405 "the head branch is behind the base branch" is yours to fix, never a reason to ask.** Update the branch yourself, with `aosguard ops forgejo pr update <owner> <repo> <index>`, the forgejo `update_pull-request` verb, or by merging `origin/main` into it and pushing, never by force. Wait for green, then merge.
* **NEVER merge on `{PULL_REQUEST}` or `{BRANCH_ONLY}`.** Those two stop where they stop, and the director merge lane carries a `{PULL_REQUEST}` from there."""
