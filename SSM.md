# AWS SSM Parameter Inventory (agentic-os)

Focused pointer to the SSM parameters `agentic-os` code reads at runtime. The
canonical fleet-wide inventory (with rotation/runbook detail) is the generated
`agentic-os-kai/SSM.md`. This file records only the params this repo's tooling
consumes, next to the code that consumes them. All values are SecureString.
Resolve at runtime via `aosguard ops aws ssm get-parameter`, never paste an opaque
id or DSN into a tracked file.
