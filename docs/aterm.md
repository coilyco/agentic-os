# The native agent terminal

`aterm` opens the window a native agent session runs in. The status-line composer filling the rows inside it is documented with the image that bakes it, in [in-container agent identity](dev-base-agent-identity.md).

## `aterm`

`aterm` opens one composed agent session in its own branded kitty window. It is the windowed sibling of `acompose`, runs the same leased shadow wrapping `agent-compose launch`, and leaves the terminal you typed in free. Name a role without a seat and both take the agent from [`harness-launch-profiles.yaml`](../.agents/harness-launch-profiles.yaml), which `aos` owns and both ask, so neither carries a second parser.

```text
aterm                              # pick a role, then a seat
aterm eng-platform                     # the role's default seat
aterm eng-platform codex -- --resume   # arguments for the harness
aterm card                         # this session's card, again
aterm --list                       # the live roster, no window
aterm --list --json                # the same roster, for a script
```

The window opens fullscreen at font size 14.5, which `--start-as` and `--font-size` override, since kitty's default 11.0 suits a terminal rather than a session you read all day. It needs `agent-compose` and kitty on `PATH` and bundles neither. Without `aos` it still launches, unleased and unconverged. `--dry-run` prints the plan and opens nothing. `--list --json` prints the launchable projection, every live role carrying only the seats `agent-compose launch` can start, under contract `aterm.roster.v1`.

**It refuses a stale role before it opens anything.** Role slugs turn over, so `aterm` reads `agent-compose catalog roles --json` on every run and names the live roster in the refusal. A transposed slug comes back as `is not a live role. Did you mean platform?` plus every live slug. A seat is checked twice: it must belong to the role and be a harness `agent-compose launch` can start. `penpot` is real but not launchable, and the refusal says which check it failed.

**An archived role is not a live one.** A seat retires by being archived, and `parseRoster` drops archived roles at the decode seam, taking them out of the picker, completion, a named launch, and `aterm bundles`.

**Tab completes from live state.** `aterm <TAB>` offers live slugs, `aterm sysadmin-senior <TAB>` only that role's launchable seats, so a turned-over slug stops completing. `aterm attach|send|status|close|clear <TAB>` offers the live sessions `aterm agents` lists. `shell/common.sh` registers bash and zsh through `aterm completion <shell>`, after `compinit` in zsh. A missing `agent-compose` or daemon yields silence, never a diagnostic mid-keystroke.

**A slow pre-flight names itself.** After two seconds `aterm` names the command it waits on.

**A failing launch stays on screen.** A terminal closes the window the moment its child exits, so a failure used to vanish before anyone read why. `aterm` runs the child through its own `_session` stage rather than handing the harness to kitty. That stage passes the exit code through and holds the window on any non-zero exit, and `--hold` holds after a clean one too. The launcher watches for a startup failure, so "no window appeared" names its cause. A claude seat runs `claude update` under the card animation, silent unless it fails.

**The title leads with what separates two windows.** A window manager truncates near 30 characters, so segments run workspace, task title, role, emblems and seat name, expression. The workspace is `repo@branch` for the checkout `--working-directory` names, left out when that is the default projects root.

**`--dry-run` reads for a person, and failures split by code.** The default renders the identity, workspace, brand swatches, each personality in its color, and the child argv. `--dry-run --json` keeps the machine plan `scripts/check-aos-release.sh` asserts against. Exit codes: 2 usage, 3 off-roster role or seat, 4 a missing dependency, 5 the window failed to open, 1 anything else, and a child's own code passes through.

**The picker reads `/dev/tty`, so `aterm > log` still prompts.**

**`aterm doctor` preflights the whole chain**, exits 1 on a broken link, and names the unleased-shadow case a launch makes silently. `--json` is `aterm.doctor.v1`.

**The identity card is the seat name, its colour, and the creature, and nothing else.** It carried the seat, tier, expression, workspace, directory, shadow line, and a personality legend keyed by emoji. Kai cut all of it. The card the launch draws and the card `aterm card` re-renders are one renderer, so the two cannot drift.

**`aterm card` re-renders the card for the session you are already inside.** The launch card loses the window to the harness on its first repaint and then leaves the terminal's history at the scrollback cap, which on a kitty at the 2000-line default is a few hours rather than 400ms. The verb reads `ATERM_CARD`, which `_session` sets on the harness it starts, so it re-renders the payload the launch already resolved rather than asking `agent-compose` again. That is what keeps it working from inside a session shadow, where re-resolving cannot (agentic-os#1460). Outside a session aterm opened, `ATERM_CARD` is unset and the verb exits 4.

**A launch from inside a native session shadow opens on the canonical environment, not on this session's.** A launch is a new session, so `aos` publishes `AOS_NATIVE_SESSION_ROOT` and the `AOS_NATIVE_CANONICAL_*` pair, and `aterm` drops every value that is a path under the session root, filters the same out of `PATH`, drops the session markers so the child leases its own, drops `CLAUDE_CODE_CHILD_SESSION` (a window is not a subagent) and `AGENT_COMPOSE_LAUNCH_DEPTH` (agent-compose 2.198.0 refuses a second hop, and `AGENT_COMPOSE_LAUNCH` stays so the launch skips converging the host), and restores `HOME` and `PROJECTS_ROOT`. An `aos` too old to publish those refuses with exit 6. `--list`, `--dry-run` and `aterm doctor` stay usable throughout, and doctor names which of the three states the session is in.

**It decodes the whole identity overlay, and renders rather than derives.** A struct naming fewer fields than the overlay ships drops the rest in silence, so `aterm/overlay.go` declares every leaf and a round-trip test fails on any that does not. The window background is the roster's `background`: separation is a property of the set, and seven accents tinted alike land inside each other's JND. aterm tints only for an agent-compose too old to ship one (agent-compose#358).

**The fixtures do not catch upstream drift, so `just aterm-contract` walks the live roster.** Every launchable seat resolves, every unlaunchable one refuses with exit 3, every timbre has a sample, and the closest background pair holds a dE 3.0 floor. Its own reason: it diffs the live overlay against the typed struct leaf by leaf, so a dropped field fails the day it is added. `ATERM_LIVE_ROSTER` makes a missing `agent-compose` fail rather than skip.

## The creature background

Every window stands its role's own creature behind the session. See
[the aterm creature background](aterm-creature.md).

## The host daemon

It routes every session. See [the aterm host daemon](aterm-daemon.md).

**`aterm resume` reopens the conversation of a session that is no longer live.** The daemon records each session's role, seat, argv, directory, home and harness dirs, never its environment, under `~/.local/state/aterm/sessions` (`ATERM_STATE_DIR` overrides), and keeps an ended one 30 days. A claude launch carries a minted `--session-id`, so the record names the conversation. `aterm resume <session or role>` relaunches the role with `--resume <id> --name <old name>`, and `--list` shows what can be resumed. Only claude is recorded, and a live session points at `aterm attach`.

## macOS app bundles

`aterm bundles` writes one `.app` per live role into `~/Desktop`. See
[aterm macOS app bundles](aterm-bundles.md).
