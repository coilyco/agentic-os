# Features

Major shipped capabilities, not files.

## Inventory

- [Shell and secrets](install.md) - shared shells, SSM, and GPG.
- [Branded agent terminal](aterm.md) - `aterm` opens an agent session in kitty, with a macOS `.app` per [role bundle](aterm-bundles.md) and a [creature](aterm-creature.md) card. `aterm pane` [splits it](aterm-pane.md). A [host daemon](aterm-daemon.md) owns sessions and shells across restarts and routes `aterm send`. A [web client](../aterm-client/README.md) attaches, with [MCP Apps](../.agents/skills/tooling-aterm-client/references/mcp-apps-gateway.md), a browser, and [Web Push](../.agents/skills/tooling-aterm-client/references/web-push.md) to a closed client. Mac and Linux.
- **Karabiner key bindings** - external keyboard and Remote Desktop mappings.
- [Agents and sessions](features-agents.md) - self-name, composition
  status, harness [and model](native-harness-config.md) policy, and
  [settings guardrails](native-claude-credentials.md).
- [Native agent workspaces](native-agent-workspaces.md) - role-scoped worktrees,
  leases, cleanup, the `aos` temp namespace, and standalone launches.
  [Shadow lifecycle](native-shadow.md) verbs list, release, and reap them.
- [Fail-closed launch provenance](native-session-start.md) - native startup
  fetches each policy source, verifies the digest Agent Compose sealed into the
  repository plan, regenerates once on a mismatch, and stops before any worktree
  exists when that cannot converge.
- [Toolchain update gate](native-session-start.md) - startup blocks daily on a
  stale `aos`, refuses off-TTY, fails open. `AOS_SKIP_UPDATE_GATE=1` bypasses.
- [Agent-compose provider](context-budget.md) - scoped skills,
  personality, and deployed roles of the Agent Compose v3 roster, via the AOS provider contract.
- [Agent tool evaluation](../.agents/skills/tooling-agent-tool-evaluation/SKILL.md) - cross-harness tool evals.
- [Role-composed skills](role-composed-skills.md) - v2 Core Roster method slices.
- [AOS launcher](aos-cli.md) - role context with
  [convergence](aos-convergence.md), [connectivity](aos-context-bundle.md),
  [kubeconfig](aos-cluster-access.md), [issue pins](aos-issue-flow.md), and
  [check-ins](aos-issue-flow.md).
- [aos run](aos-cli.md) - `aos run <verb>` resolves a just verb to the resident repository
  declaring it, reports how far that checkout trails its upstream, and `--handoff` prints the
  absolute-path line to run outside a session shadow.
- [aosguard](../.agents/skills/tooling-aosguard/references/aosguard.md) - guarded CLI with PR
  merge, sealed
  [Forgejo storage measurement](../.agents/skills/tooling-aosguard/references/forgejo-ops.md),
  and a guarded `gh` replacement withholding every pull-request write.
- [Guarded helm releases](../.agents/skills/tooling-aosguard/references/guardfile-headers.md) - cluster-pinned upgrade, install, and rollback with release destruction unexposed.
- [Code review skill](../.agents/composed/tooling-code-review/COMPOSED.md) - Portfolio Director gate-decision review stance.
- [Code review contract](../CODE-REVIEW.md) - review invariants.
- [Forgejo Actions logs and rerun](../.agents/skills/tooling-aosguard/references/forgejo-actions-runs.md) - job logs, run ZIPs, and a guarded rerun of a failed pull-request run.
- [Forgejo runner tokens](../.agents/skills/tooling-aosguard/references/forgejo-ops.md) - guarded registration-token minting.
- [Homebrew updates](../.agents/skills/tooling-aosguard/references/guardfile-headers.md) - `aosguard update brew` refreshes tap metadata, upgrades this estate's own formulae first, then the rest, and exits non-zero on anything left behind.
- [Teable schema admin](../.agents/skills/tooling-aosguard/references/teable-admin.md) - guarded field and table creation plus select-choice rename/add, each re-read and refused unless it stored as asked. Free convert and table-delete are refused by name.
- [Teable personal records](../.agents/skills/tooling-aosguard/references/teable-personal.md) - guarded record reads and writes over one SSM-pinned base that the caller cannot name. Writes re-read before reporting success, and record-delete is unmounted and refused by name.
- [Ward integration boundary](ward-specs.md) - one generic runner for every
  [composed role](aos-cli.md#generic-warded-roles), and no role-derived authority.
- [Cross-repo tooling and release](release.md) - aos-precommit and release operations.
- [dev-base image](dev-base-image.md) - parallel cached language payloads feeding one automatically released full development surface.
- [Pinned and vendored build inputs](vendor-forgejo-policy.md) - the Forgejo policy pushes down to deploy, and the WASM toolchain is baked so no build downloads it.
- [CI parity in dev-base](ci-in-dev-base.md) - CI runs inside the moving :release dev-base image.
- [Pull-request CI gate](ci-in-dev-base.md) - fast tests and Docker-only image validation.
- [AGENTS pointer](features-agents.md) - generated sibling-repo workspace pointer.
- [AGENTS git-workflow block](build-file-headers.md) - generated per-lane standing authorization to commit, branch, push, and open a PR. One fleet lane, `pull-request-and-merge`.
- **Brand case** - the brand name is lowercase in prose, or all caps
  (`COILYCO`) as a standalone title. Code, URLs and link targets are exempt, and
  a literal external identifier takes an `allow` entry.
- [Encoded leak guard](pre-commit-hygiene.md) - hex-encoded leak-term detector.
- [Outbound link hygiene](pre-commit-hygiene.md) - offline validator for links
  leaving the repo, driven by a retired-name and retired-path table, plus a
  report-only liveness CLI for a scheduled job.
- [Managed line endings](pre-commit-hygiene.md) - generated `.gitattributes`
  block pinning the working tree to LF, with vendored trees and vendor orgs
  left alone.
- [Context measurement](context-budget.md) - reusable harness-neutral role
  capture, multi-provider attribution, and deterministic component diffs.
- [AGENTS inventory](agents-context-inventory.md) - fleet corpus and clipping candidates.
- [Repository residency](repo-layout.md) - Agent Compose native-workspace adapter and status tracking.
- [Catalog caps reference](catalog-caps-reference.md) - generated numeric caps for validators.
- [TLS trust-store fallback](../.agents/skills/tooling-aosguard/references/tls-trust-store.md) -
  operator verbs and repo modules load a system CA bundle when the interpreter
  ships without one, instead of failing every HTTPS call closed with an error
  that reads like a bad endpoint. Verification is never weakened.
- [Narrative guides shelf](documentation-bands.md) - `guides/*.md` as a second
  structural documentation type beside `docs/*.md`, with its own roomier size
  caps and no count cap, so an end-to-end walkthrough has somewhere legal to
  live when the reference shelf is full.
- [Centrally ratified documentation exclusions](ratifying-an-exclusion.md) -
  a `documentation-layout` exclusion applies only when the repo's own config and
  agentic-os both name it, so adding one costs two pull requests, a release and
  a pin bump, while removing one costs one. An unratified local pattern fails
  the hook by name rather than silently not applying.
- [Issue-ref links](../scripts/issue-ref-links.sh) - a Stop hook naming the URL that resolves each
  hash-ref in a reply, read off the payload key rather than the unflushed transcript. Warn first,
  and never a Forgejo issue URL.
- [PR merge-status check](../scripts/pr-merge-status-check.py) - a Stop hook asking Forgejo
  whether each cited pull request really merged. Blocks on a contradiction.
- [Canonical agent-id generator](build-output-is-not-content.md) - short lowercase agent IDs.
- Skill mounts - `aos skills mount`.
