# Native session shadow

The per-session checkout a native launch runs in, and the home beside it.

A native AOS launch runs the agent inside a per-session shadow instead of the canonical checkout. Workspace projection itself is in [native agent workspaces](native-agent-workspaces.md).

## Session markers

`AOS_NATIVE_SESSION` carries the session id and `AOS_NATIVE_SESSION_PROJECTS` carries the session `projects` root. Both are exported only by a launch that links at least one worktree. A launch linking none leaves both unset, because it stays in the canonical checkout and no isolation claim would be true there. An agent reads the pair as the authoritative answer to whether it is isolated, rather than pattern-matching its own working directory against a path. `AOS_NATIVE_SESSION_ROOT` and the `AOS_NATIVE_CANONICAL_*` pair travel with them, for [nested launches](aterm.md).

`AOS_REPO_ROOT` names the canonical checkout and is unrelated. It is set by the shell base and the container entrypoint, so it stays populated inside a shadow and points away from it.

## Durability asymmetry

Session worktrees are linked from the canonical repository, so they share its Git object store. A commit is durable the moment it is written, because the objects land in the canonical repository rather than in the session directory. Branch refs likewise outlive the session.

The working tree has no such protection. It lives under the platform temporary root, which the operating system purges on its own schedule. macOS empties `DARWIN_USER_TEMP_DIR` through `com.apple.bsd.dirhelper`, deleting files by access time and leaving the directory skeleton behind, which surfaces in Git as a worktree that is `prunable` with a missing gitdir.

Committed work therefore survives a purged shadow and uncommitted work has no second copy. That asymmetry is the mechanism behind the remote-checkpoint rule.

## Lifecycle verbs

`aos _native-shadow` reads and reclaims as well as launching.

* `--list [--json]` - every lease, whether its process is live, whether the worktree is still on disk, how many commits sit on no remote, and one line saying what holds a session that cannot be released. `aterm.roster.v1`'s sibling contract is `agentic-os.native-shadows.v1`.
* `--release [<id>]` - a session declaring itself finished. It marks the lease and never tears down a process that may still be running, so the worktree goes on the next sweep. Defaults to `$AOS_NATIVE_SESSION`.
* `--session-id <code>` - the code a launcher named the shadow with, from `aos _session-id`, used unless taken. The aterm session name no longer carries it.
* `--reap [--dry-run]` - runs the sweep an operator would otherwise have to trigger by launching another session. The dry run reports the same verdict the sweep enforces, the grace included, rather than a larger optimistic one.

A dead lease waits out a 24-hour grace, because a crash and a clean exit look identical from outside. `--release` is the session saying which it was, and a released lease skips the grace once its process is gone.

## Why a landed branch used to be unreapable

A session branch goes once its commits exist somewhere else, which `git rev-list <branch> --not --remotes=origin` answered until the forge started squash-merging and deleting remote branches, leaving it "unpushed" forever.

Patch identity cannot see it either, since a two-commit squash shows both as unmerged under `git cherry`. Content can, two ways. Reaping needs a merge into origin/main that changes nothing, or an empty `git diff origin/main <branch> -- <paths it touched>` and a pruned upstream. A branch main holds whole is released even if never pushed, and one main moved past stays held and says so (agentic-os#8277). The warnings only silence a line, so they ask wider: `merge-tree --write-tree -X ours origin/main <branch>` returning main's own tree means merging changes nothing, and `-X ours` drops only the hunks main resolved itself, so a branch-only hunk still warns. Needs git 2.43 (agentic-os#7687).

Session branches are also the ID ledger `reserveNativeSession` reads, so one is reaped only when no lease and no worktree still names it. Recycling a live session's ID is the hazard, and the lease tells them apart.

## Hand-made worktrees

An agent working without a shadow still needs isolation from a checkout holding foreign work. Those worktrees belong under the platform cache at `agentic-os/agent-worktrees`, not in the temporary directory. A hand-made worktree carries no session lease, so nothing sweeps or recreates it, and a purge there destroys the only copy of anything uncommitted.

A shadow stays on its session branch either way. Why, and the guards that enforce it: [default branch ownership](native-session-start.md).

## Native shadow home

An assigned-role launch stages a shadow `HOME` under the session root. Every host entry becomes a symlink back to the real home, so credentials, caches, and tool config keep working.

## Staged config directories

`.agent-compose`, `.agents`, `.claude`, `.codex`, and `.config` (plus its `goose` and `opencode` children) are staged rather than linked whole: each becomes a real directory whose entries are symlinks. Agent-compose projects the composed role into this home at the harness global load points, and a projection resolves symlinks, so a directory linked whole would write the host's copy instead of the session's.

Inside those directories the projected load points are reserved, which means no host copy is linked over them: `.claude/CLAUDE.md`, `.codex/AGENTS.md`, `.config/goose/.goosehints`, `.config/opencode/AGENTS.md`, and the `skills` directories. Projection refuses foreign files, so a leftover host link there would fail the launch rather than be replaced. `.agent-compose` leaves out `projection.json` and `skill-mounts.json`, since a shared record let one seat refuse or prune another's launch. Reserving them is also what makes role scoping real: the host instructions file carries every role, and leaving it in place put all of them in context beside the one selected role.

Staging changes where new writes land. An entry that already exists still resolves to the host through its symlink, but a file the session creates under a staged directory stays in the session. `~/.config` is the one worth knowing, since tools write there without being asked.

## The projects hole

`$PROJECTS_ROOT` is the one host entry the shadow home leaves out.

The session already owns writable worktrees under `<session>/projects`, one per resident checkout, each on its own `aos/<harness>/<id>` branch. Linking the host projects root into the shadow home would give the canonical checkouts a second name inside the session. That name resolves past the worktrees to the shared trees on `main`.

An agent that reaches for `~/projects/<owner>/<repo>` out of habit lands in the shared checkout, edits it, and commits there. Two sessions doing that at once collide over one index, and each can absorb the other's in-flight files into its commit. Both stay entirely inside their own isolation the whole time.

Leaving the entry absent turns that into an immediate "no such file or directory" instead of a silent wrong answer.

## Working in a session

Use the launch directory and relative paths. `pwd` at startup is the session tree, and `git rev-parse --git-dir` resolves to a `worktrees/` entry under the canonical repository, which is how a session checkout is recognized.

Reaching the canonical tree on purpose is still possible through its absolute `/Users/<user>/projects` path. The guard removes the accident, not the capability.

## Scope

The rule binds `stageNativeRoleHome`, which serves assigned-role and workspace -root launches. `stageStandaloneRoleHome` copies a narrow allowlist instead of mirroring the home, so it never had the entry. A `PROJECTS_ROOT` override is matched by inode identity, not by the literal name `projects`.
