# AOS launcher and its release train

AOS exposes one launch shape with composed context and guarded tools always present.

The shared role slug selects context across capabilities, never transfers authority, and standalone AOS applies [bounded access gates](aos-cluster-access.md).

## Launch modes

Every AOS launch has two contexts: agent-compose verifies and projects the selected role into a private staged home, and AOS attaches standalone `aosguard` with its umbra credential mounts. The compatibility flags `--composed` and `--guarded` are still accepted, explicit false values included, but disable neither.

`aos` and `aoscompose` name the standalone container `<role>-<suffix>`, and `aoscomposed` stays compatible. `aoscompose` uses Docker host networking. First positional selects role, a second harness overrides the default, and auth is default-on: use `--auth=false` only for startup checks such as `aoscompose platform --version`.

`aosward` is the same executable with warded mode forced, equal to `aos --warded` and not disablable by `--warded=false`. It takes the ordinary flags plus a trailing issue reference, and uses Ward's generic runner and broker for Compose, lifecycle, and [credential handoff](aos-cluster-access.md).

## Routing

In warded mode, arguments after `--` go to Ward with the image, agent, role, workspace request, and context bundle. Harness model and effort settings never change composition. AOS gives Agent Compose the role, delivery mode, and the role's first roster-supported compatibility tier, identical across seats and unrelated to model or context-window size. Agent Compose owns identity and seat context, and Ward cannot change privileged surface. See the [context-bundle adapter](aos-context-bundle.md).

Ward ships the `director`, `qa`, and `engineer` repository workflows. Other safe roles use its [generic read-only command](#generic-warded-roles). AOS rejects incompatible agents and translated Ward flags before starting a container.

**The root action routes to Ward, the `acompose` subcommand does not.** It once took `--warded` and exited zero, so a standalone container could read as Ward-brokered. It now refuses that flag, `--guarded`, and `--agent` before materialization, naming the root form instead (agentic-os#810).

## Standalone contract

* Default image pulls each launch, custom images stay local, and standalone uses the native shadow: worktrees at `/workspace`, mapped CWD as workdir. HOME is copied to `/home/aos` from an allowlist, and composition hydrates the baked provider through `aos-substrate-cache`.
* [Authentication](aos-auth.md) fails closed before Docker and projects file-backed or Keychain credentials read-only, auth env names crossing unrendered under `--auth=true`.
* [Connectivity](aos-context-bundle.md) keeps host networking, MCP, and tailnet behavior, and [kubeconfig](aos-cluster-access.md) mounts one source read-only.
* Host HOME, AWS, Git, and Docker stay out, so credentials use auth projection only.

Root performs bootstrap only and the harness runs as the host uid and gid. Composition verifies the immutable bundle with `project --scope home`, and `--no-substrate` omits unrelated reference trees.
## Validation and release

`just aos-test` runs Go, and the `aos-composition-dry-run`, `aos-composition-smoke`, and `aos-standalone-composition-smoke` verbs cover both lifecycle shapes. The standalone smoke uses `--auth=false` and a version command, so it proves startup rather than authenticated inference, and the [auth contract](aos-auth.md) names the inference probe.

## aos CLI release

The portable CLI has an independent `aos-vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` clock inside the agentic-os Forgejo repository. Root `v*` tags remain owned by the full dev-base image and hooks use `aos-precommit-v*`, so CLI delivery never waits on either.

## Automatic release

The promoted `release` branch drives `.forgejo/workflows/aos-cli-release.yml`, whose path filter covers the shipped Go roots, AOSguard specs and bridges, the Specgen pin, and release scripts, and manual dispatch is the retry path. The release job validates through Ward, bumps the CLI minor version without reading commit messages, cross-compiles and tag-stamps every native binary, packages each target bundle, renders checksums plus Homebrew and Scoop metadata, creates or reuses the Forgejo release, replaces every asset from a clean `dist/`, and updates the tap and bucket when their write tokens exist.

Assets group `aos-*`, `aos-bundle-*`, `aoscompose-*`, `aosward-*`, `aosguard-*`, and `aterm-*` per target, with `SHA256SUMS`, `aos.rb`, and `aos.json` covering the version-aligned set. `aterm` reads its own [target list](../aterm/release-targets.txt), which has no Windows entry, so the Scoop manifest installs everything but it.

## Install

Homebrew on macOS or Linux taps `coilyco-flight-deck/tap`, Scoop on Windows adds the `coilyco` bucket. Exact commands are in [the README](../README.md).

Both put `aos`, `aoscompose`, `aoscomposed`, `aosward`, `aosguard`, and `aterm` on `PATH`. `aoscomposed` aliases `aoscompose`, `aosward` forces warded mode from its executable name, `aosguard` carries the operator CLI and Actions bridge, and `aterm` is the [branded session launcher](aterm.md).

Publication consumes the repo-scoped `TAP_WRITE_TOKEN` and `SCOOP_WRITE_TOKEN` Actions secrets, synchronized from SSM by `just sync-actions-secrets`, and an operator supplies the attended `FORGEJO_ADMIN_TOKEN` in memory.

Workflow dispatch accepts an existing or explicit `aos-v*` tag, or the operator selects patch, minor, or major. Existing releases and same-named assets are reused and replaced, so a retry is idempotent.

## Local validation

`just aos-release-build` creates the binaries and `SHA256SUMS`. With `AOS_RELEASE_VERSION` set, `aos-release-package` renders local metadata and `aos-release-check` verifies checksums, versions, `--help`, an `aterm --dry-run` against roster and overlay fixtures, and that `aterm` refuses an off-roster role. The ordinary Go tests and pre-commit verbs remain the release gate.

## Generic warded roles

AOS no longer limits warded composition to Ward's fixed repository workflows. Any safe lowercase role slug can use the generic runner:

```bash
aosward --agent codex --role story-architect --agent-id architect -- \
  "shape the premise and ask a critic to pressure-test it"
```

AOS translates this to:

```bash
ward agent run --role story-architect --agent-id architect \
  "shape the premise and ask a critic to pressure-test it"
```

The selected harness, image, model environment, and immutable context bundle follow the same AOS-owned translation for every role.

If a matching Ward director broker is already running for that repository and harness, the generic run joins its peer-message group automatically.

The distinction is authority, not identity:

* Every safe role uses Ward's read-only one-shot lifecycle, `director`, `science`, and `platform` included.
* A role slug selects composed context only. It cannot grant credentials, mounts, network access, or landing authority.

Within a Ward broker group, generic agents may launch other generic peers and use Ward's authenticated message channel. Their derived peer capability cannot select platform or science or invoke privileged broker operations.
